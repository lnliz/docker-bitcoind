This repo builds [`bitcoind`] in an [auditable way](https://github.com/lnliz/docker-bitcoind), and packages it into a minimal Docker containers provided for various CPU architectures.

## Usage

### Pull

First pull the image from [Docker Hub]:

```bash
docker pull lnliz/bitcoind:v30.1
```

> **NOTE:** Running above will automatically choose native architecture of your CPU.

[Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/lnliz/bitcoind

Or, to pull a specific CPU architecture:

```bash
docker pull lnliz/bitcoind:v30.1-arm64v8
```

#### Start

First of all, create a directory in your home directory called `.bitcoin`

Next, create a config file. You can take a look at the following sample: thebox-compose-system ([1](https://github.com/lnliz/thebox-compose-system/blob/master/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)).

Some guides on how to configure bitcoin can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bitcoin-conf.md) (bitcoin git repo)

Then to start bitcoind, run:

```bash
docker run  -it  --rm  --detach \
    -v ~/.bitcoin:/data/.bitcoin \
    -p 8332:8332 \
    -p 8333:8333 \
    -p 28332:28332 \
    -p 28333:28333 \
    --name bitcoind \
    lnliz/bitcoind:v30.1
```

That will run bitcoind such that:

* all data generated by the container is stored in `~/.bitcoin` **on your host machine**,
* port `8332` will be reachable for the RPC communication,
* port `8333` will be reachable for the peer-to-peer communication,
* port `28332` will be reachable for ZMQ **block** notifications,
* port `28333` will be reachable for ZMQ **transaction** notifications,
* created container will get named `bitcoind`,
* within the container, `bitcoind` binary is run as unprivileged user `bitcoind` (`UID=1000`),
* that command will run the container in the background and print the ID of the container being run.


#### Bitcoin Inquisition

You can also use [Bitcoin Inquisition](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin) by using different image tag:

```bash
docker pull lnliz/bitcoind:v29.1.inq
```


#### Knots

You can also use [Bitcoin Knots](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin) by using different image tag:

```bash
docker pull lnliz/bitcoind:v29.1.knots20250903
```


#### Interact

To issue any commands to a running container, do:

```bash
docker exec -it bitcoind BINARY COMMAND
```

Where:
* `BINARY` is either `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, `bitcoin-tx`, (or `bitcoin-wallet` on `v0.18+`) and
* `COMMAND` is something you'd normally pass to the binary   

Examples:

```bash
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoind --help
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoind --version
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli --help
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli -getinfo
docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli getblockcount
```

### Docker Compose
Here is a docker-compose.yml for mainnet
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  bitcoin:
    container_name: bitcoind
    user: 1000:1000
    image: lnliz/bitcoind:v30.1
    volumes:
      - ./bitcoin:/data/.bitcoin
    restart: on-failure
    stop_grace_period: 15m30s
    ports:
      - "8333:8333"
      - "8332:8332"
      - "28332:28332"
      - "28333:28333"
```
First, ensure that the `bitcoin/` folder is in the directory containing docker-compose.yml.
Then, Docker Compose will mount the `bitcoin/` folder to `/data/.bitcoin`.


#### Details

* **All builds aim to be maximally auditable.**  After `git tag push`, the entire process is automated, with each step printed, and the code aiming to be easy to follow
* All builds are based on [Alpine]
* Cross-compiled builds are done using our (also auditable) [`qemu`]
* To fit build and complete `make check` test suite, BerkeleyDB is build separately [here]
* Each build produces binaries for: `amd64`, `arm64v8`, and `arm32v7`
* All architectures are aggregated under an easy-to-use [Docker Manifest]
* All [`git-tags`] are [build automatically], and with an [auditable trace]
* Each successful build of a `git tag` pushes result Docker image to [Docker Hub]
* Images pushed to Docker Hub are never deleted (even if `lnd` version gets overridden, previous one is preserved)
* All `final` images are based on Alpine for minimum base size
* All binaries are [`strip`ped]
* Each `git-tag` build is tagged with a unique tag number
* Each _minor_ version is stored in a separate directory (for the ease of backporting patches)


> **NOTE:** ZMQ `block` and `tx` ports are set to `28332` and `28333` respectively. 


#### Troubleshooting

##### Bitcoind isn't starting

Here are some possible reasons why.

###### Permissions for the bitcoin data directory is not correct

The permissions for the bitcoin data direct is assumed to be UID 1000 (first user). 

If you have a different setup, please do the following

```bash
# where ".bitcoin" is the data directory
sudo chown -R 1000.1000 $HOME/.bitcoin
```
